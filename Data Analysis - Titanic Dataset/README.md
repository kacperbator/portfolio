# Titanic Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the Titanic dataset. The analysis explores passenger demographics, survival rates, and correlations between various features and survival likelihood. This project serves as an introduction to data analysis and visualization using Python.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Statistical insights and correlation analysis.
- Insights into survival factors such as age, gender, class, and fare.

## Dependencies

To run the analysis, the following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is included in the repository. Ensure that the `titanic.csv` file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kacperbator/portfolio/tree/accd2cdb3c41def9bc7b6174552366baf1c1ce73/Data%20Analysis%20-%20Titanic%20Dataset
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
    ```bash
    cd portfolio/Data\ Analysis\ -\ Titanic\ Dataset
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook titanic_data_analysis.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Key Insights

- **Survival Rates:** Analysis of survival rates across different passenger classes, genders, and age groups.
- **Correlations:** Insights into the correlation between ticket fares and survival likelihood.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representations of data distributions and survival patterns.
